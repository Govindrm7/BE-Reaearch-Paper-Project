# MRI Image Enhancement for Brain Tumor Detection Research (June 2021 - June 2023)

## Objective
Enhancing the quality of MRI images for improved brain tumor detection through a hybridized approach of contrast enhancement techniques.

## Methodology
Developed an algorithmic model in both Jupyter Notebook and MATLAB to enhance MRI images characterized by blurriness and low brightness, facilitating more accurate brain tissue diagnosis.

## Techniques Used
Employed a hybridization of various contrast enhancement techniques, including Fuzzy, Histogram Equalization (HE), Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE), and Root Mean Square Histogram Equalization (RMSHE), to enhance image quality.

## Publication and Presentation
- Presented and published the research paper at the IEEE Conference 2022 (ICKES), showcasing the developed algorithm and its impact on improving MRI image clarity for brain tumor analysis.
